# nyc_dob_violations

### High-level overview

To study building- and construction-related problems in the city, with the goal of deriving some insight into potential causes and solutions.

#### Complaints

Complaints are where a lot of violations will presumably start - i.e. a resident, constituent, etc. being unhappy with something could lead to the city investigating, which could eventually lead to a violation.

#### Permits

Permitting is also very much tied to the problems as, often times, the city may inadvertently approve things that are hamrful to constituents, due to their lack of capacity to oversee construction, property management, etc. in a detailed way.

#### Violations

These are the events where the city has (as far as we know) actually come to a place where they have found demonstrably inappropriate behavior.

#### Tying it all together

We want to look at how each of these measurse has changed over time, and how they are intertwined.

### Analysis details

We want to look at each of _permits_, _complaints_, _violations_, both on their own and together.

#### Individual analyses
- long-term trends
- seasonal / periodic activity
- raw data, and normalized by city / borough population

#### As-a-group analyses
- correlation
- regression analysis
- both of the above should take lagged variable(s) into account
